# Contribution Guidelines 

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Openboard. It's people like you that make projects like this possible!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What kind of contributions are we looking for?

All sorts of them! In our current stage, we will definitely need help from folks with UI/UX chops and developers of all skill levels. In later stages, we 
will need contributions for creating/improving documentation and marketing help. Reach out to any of the contributors for this project to see how you can help!

### Ground Rules

* Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: https://gist.github.com/champagneabuelo/5a0a1753a430dfe50167b1fad4395596
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).


### Never made a pull request to an open source project before? 
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

### Getting started

Please read about our git branching model: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
* Tl;dr: please create any new features off the develop branch!

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a 
contributor as a patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants

### How to report a bug

_If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Contact one of the contributors instead._

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Go/Elm are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### How to suggest a feature or enhancement

We welcome any suggestions for improvement! Please open an issue and add a 'improvement' tag to it.
